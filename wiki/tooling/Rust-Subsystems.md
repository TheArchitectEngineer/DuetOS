## Overview

Rust in DuetOS is a kernel subsystem tool, not a second application
framework. A Rust crate is appropriate when the subsystem owns a clear
boundary with attacker-controlled structured bytes or lifetime-heavy state,
such as DuetFS, USB class descriptors, or the TCP/IP stack. C++ remains the
orchestration language for the kernel image.

"Attacker-controlled bytes" means bytes that cross a trust boundary before the
kernel has parsed them: USB descriptors returned by a plugged-in device, network
packets from the wire, filesystem metadata from removable media, and PE/ELF
metadata from an executable image. The attacker is not assumed to have code
execution yet; the risk is that a malicious device or image can choose lengths,
offsets, counts, nesting depth, and tag ordering that stress every parser edge
case.

Rust is not magic sandboxing and it does not make an unsafe FFI boundary safe by
itself. It is useful here because the byte walkers can be written as
bounds-checked slice traversal with checked/saturating arithmetic, no ambient
aliasing, and no unchecked pointer increments in the parser core. In C++ the
same parser can be made correct, but every `ptr + len`, cast, packed-struct
view, and manual lifetime convention must stay correct forever; one missed
bounds check can become a kernel read/write primitive. DuetOS therefore keeps
C++ as the owning/orchestration layer and uses Rust selectively for narrow
parsers where memory-safety bugs are the main risk.

## Candidate priority

The first Rust slice covers DuetFS plus USB descriptor parsers, but it does
not exhaust the high-risk surface. Prioritize future Rust crates where the
subsystem is mostly byte parsing or state-machine validation and can expose a
small C ABI back to the C++ owner.

| Priority | Candidate | Why it is high risk | Rust boundary shape |
|----------|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| P0 | Network packet parsers (Ethernet / ARP / IPv4 / ICMP / UDP / TCP options, DHCP / DNS where applicable) | Remote peers control packet lengths, header offsets, fragmentation state, option lists, and checksummed payload shape. A parser bug is remotely reachable before auth. | Parse borrowed RX buffers into validated header/value structs; C++ keeps NIC rings, routing, timers, and socket ownership. |
| P0 | PE/COFF and ELF metadata readers | Executable images control section tables, data-directory RVAs, imports, relocations, TLS records, resources, and symbol/export tables. This sits directly on the project pillar of running PE binaries. | Rust validates image metadata and returns a relocation/import/load plan; C++ owns address-space mapping, capability checks, and process creation. |
| P0 | Read-only disk-format parsers not already in Rust (NTFS / exFAT / FAT32 / ext4 metadata walkers) | Removable or dual-boot disks control superblocks, directory entries, extents, runlists, timestamps, and string encodings. The kernel must reject malformed metadata without trusting lengths or offsets. | Rust turns blocks into validated directory / inode / extent records; C++ VFS owns handles, caching policy, block devices, and permissions. |
| P1 | Font and image decoders used by UI or boot assets (TTF, PNG, BMP/TGA where non-trivial) | Asset files can be supplied by themes, apps, or downloaded content and tend to contain nested tables, compressed streams, and attacker-chosen dimensions. | Rust decodes/validates metadata and bounded spans; C++ renderer owns surfaces, glyph cache, and GPU upload. |
| P1 | Protocol control-plane parsers (USB RNDIS/CDC control messages, Bluetooth HCI events, Wi-Fi management frames/EAPOL) | Devices or nearby radios control variable-length protocol records and state transitions. Bugs can be reached from hardware, radio, or network-adjacent inputs. | Rust parses envelopes and validates state-machine messages; C++ owns driver rings, DMA, IRQs, and kernel object lifetimes. |
| P2 | ACPI/SMBIOS/PCI capability-table readers | Firmware controls table lengths, offsets, checksums, and nested structures before the kernel has a normal trust base. Bugs are usually local/firmware-level, but they run very early. | Rust validates table walks into plain records; C++ owns boot sequencing, MMIO mapping, and architecture effects. |

Do **not** move code to Rust just because it is important. Scheduler paths,
address-space mutation, IRQ dispatch, DMA ring programming, and GPU command
submission are high-consequence but not automatically good Rust candidates: they
are dominated by hardware side effects, lock ordering, and existing C++ kernel
ownership. Rust is the best fit when the risky part can be isolated as
"bytes/state in, validated plan out."

The repository now has one shared Rust foundation **and actual Rust subsystem code**:

- `/rust-toolchain.toml` pins the nightly toolchain and bare-metal target.
- `/Cargo.toml` is the workspace root and owns the profiles for every Rust
  crate linked into the kernel.
- `/Cargo.lock` is tracked so dependency resolution is reproducible; CMake
  invokes cargo with `--locked`. This freezes package selection but is **not**
  an offline or hermetic dependency source: a clean Cargo home may still fetch
  the registry index and crates. Use a previously populated cache for offline
  builds; a separately reviewed vendored-source policy is still required before
  the Rust build can be called network-independent.
- `/.cargo/config.toml` selects `x86_64-unknown-none` and the `build-std`
  knobs needed by freestanding crates.
- `/kernel/rust/` is the single Rust staticlib link unit. Subsystem crates are
  rlibs; the aggregate staticlib pulls in `core` / `alloc` / panic runtime once
  so the C++ kernel link does not get duplicate Rust runtime objects.
- `/kernel/fs/duetfs/` is the native filesystem Rust subsystem.
- `/kernel/drivers/usb/hid_rust/` is the USB HID report-descriptor parser Rust
  subsystem; C++ HID APIs are wrappers over this parser.
- `/kernel/drivers/usb/class_rust/` parses USB configuration/interface/endpoint
  descriptor streams for MSC, hub, UVC, and Bluetooth class-driver binding.
- `/kernel/net/parsers_rust/` (`duetos_net_parsers`) wraps the DHCPv4 option
  walker and the DNSv1 name skipper. C++ callers in `kernel/net/stack.cpp`
  delegate `DhcpFindOption` and `DnsSkipName` through this crate.
- `/kernel/drivers/usb/msc_scsi_rust/` (`duetos_usb_msc_scsi`) parses USB MSC
  SCSI INQUIRY / READ CAPACITY(10) / GET CONFIGURATION header / READ TOC
  header / READ DISC INFORMATION responses. The C++ MSC driver
  (`kernel/drivers/usb/msc_scsi.cpp`) delegates its parse functions through
  this crate.
- `/kernel/util/img_meta_rust/` (`duetos_img_meta`) validates PNG, BMP,
  TGA, and JPEG / JFIF / EXIF image headers.
  `kernel/util/png.cpp::PngParseHeader`,
  `kernel/util/bmp.cpp::BmpParseHeader`,
  `kernel/util/tga.cpp::TgaParseHeader`, and
  `kernel/util/jpeg.cpp::JpegParseHeader` all delegate to this crate;
  the C++ side keeps zlib inflate, scanline filter unwind, and
  pixel-copy. The JPEG validator walks segments from the SOI marker
  until the first Start-of-Frame (SOF) and extracts dimensions +
  precision + component count without entering the entropy-coded
  scan data. No decoder lives in the tree yet; the validator is the
  toolkit a future viewer / thumbnail cache / wallpaper-extension
  consumer will sit on.
- `/kernel/loader/exec_meta_rust/` (`duetos_exec_meta`) validates ELF64
  files (header + every PT_LOAD segment) and PE/COFF images
  (DOS stub + e_lfanew bounds + PE signature + AMD64 machine check +
  optional-header magic / section / file alignment + image-base
  low-half bound + section-table bounds + per-section raw extent fit).
  `kernel/loader/elf_loader.cpp::ElfValidate` and the body of
  `kernel/loader/pe_loader.cpp::ParseHeaders` (up to but not including
  the data-directory walks) delegate to this crate; the C++ side keeps
  data-directory checks, address-space mapping, capability checks, and
  process creation.
- `/kernel/fs/ntfs_rust/` (`duetos_ntfs`) parses NTFS boot sectors,
  MFT record headers, resident `$FILE_NAME` attributes, and runlist
  (mapping-pairs) entries. `kernel/fs/ntfs.cpp` delegates byte
  parsing to this crate; UTF-16 → ASCII translation stays in C++.
- `/kernel/fs/exfat_rust/` (`duetos_exfat`) parses exFAT VBRs,
  derives cluster geometry, walks the FAT chain (4-byte LE per
  cluster), and decodes dirent sets (File 0x85 + Stream-Extension
  0xC0 + FileName 0xC1 tuples). `kernel/fs/exfat.cpp` delegates
  byte parsing to this crate.
- `/kernel/fs/ext4_rust/` (`duetos_ext4`) parses ext2/3/4
  superblocks, group descriptors, inode records, extent headers,
  extent leaves / index nodes, and linux_dirent records.
  `kernel/fs/ext4.cpp` delegates byte parsing to this crate;
  block I/O, scratch management, and the depth>0 extent-tree DFS
  stay in C++.
- `/kernel/acpi/acpi_rust/` (`duetos_acpi`) parses RSDP v1 / v2,
  ACPI table headers, MADT entry headers, FADT body fields, MCFG
  entries, HPET descriptors, and SRAT memory-affinity entries.
  `kernel/acpi/acpi.cpp::AcpiInit` delegates the RSDP
  signature + checksum validation to the crate; `ParseFadt`
  cross-validates its packed-struct overlay against the Rust
  decoder.
- `/kernel/acpi/aml_rust/` (`duetos_aml`) is the recursive AML
  TermList walker over the DSDT / SSDT bytecode: PkgLength /
  NameString decode, Scope / Device / Method / Name / OperationRegion /
  Mutex / Event / Alias / External / Processor / ThermalZone /
  PowerResource records, and the constant-bound NamedField index.
  `kernel/acpi/aml.cpp::WalkTable` delegates one table's byte parse to
  the crate's `duetos_aml_walk_table`, which appends named-object
  records straight into the kernel's namespace / region / field tables
  (layout-asserted FFI mirrors). C++ keeps the table storage,
  accessors, and the offset slicers (`AmlMethodBody` / `AmlNameValue` /
  `AmlReadS5`); the AML *evaluator* (`aml_eval.cpp`, hardware FieldUnit
  I/O) stays C++. Continuously fuzzed by `tests/fuzz/fuzz_aml`.
- `/kernel/net/wifi80211_rust/` (`duetos_wifi80211`) parses 802.11
  frame headers, Beacon / Probe Response body prefixes, the IE
  (Information Element) list, and EAPOL-Key (4-way handshake)
  descriptors. `kernel/net/wireless/beacon.cpp::BeaconParse`
  delegates the frame header, body, and IE walks to the crate.
  Fuzzed directly via `cargo fuzz` (not a `tests/fuzz/fuzz_*.cpp`
  harness — see `kernel/net/wifi80211_rust/fuzz/`), one target per
  FFI entry point.
- `/kernel/net/hci_rust/` (`duetos_hci`) parses Bluetooth HCI
  event packets and the Command Complete, Command Status,
  Disconnection Complete, LE Meta, Read_Local_Version, and
  Read_BD_ADDR bodies. `kernel/net/bluetooth/hci.cpp` delegates
  the Read_Local_Version + Read_BD_ADDR rparam decoders to the
  crate.
- `/kernel/drivers/net/iwlwifi_fw_rust/` (`duetos_iwlwifi_fw`)
  walks the Intel iwlwifi TLV firmware blob: 88-byte preamble
  (zero + magic + 64-byte name + ver + build + 8 ignored) +
  stream of `(u32 type, u32 length, payload[length], pad-to-4)`
  TLV records. Recognises INST / DATA / INIT / INIT_DATA /
  SEC_RT / FLAGS / NUM_OF_CPU / FW_VERSION / PHY_SKU / HW_TYPE;
  unknown TLVs bump a counter without failing the parse. Every
  `off + 8 + length` arithmetic uses checked_add so a hostile
  TLV length can't wrap into a smaller "fits the blob" value.
  `kernel/drivers/net/iwlwifi_fw.cpp` delegates byte parsing
  to this crate; C++ side keeps the sanitize-for-serial-print
  pass on the human-readable name.
- `/kernel/drivers/net/rtl88xx_fw_rust/` (`duetos_rtl88xx_fw`)
  walks the Realtek rtlwifi/rtw88/rtw89 32-byte fixed firmware
  header. Classifies the generation by signature
  (rtl8192/8723/8821/8812/8814 → rtlwifi, 0x88B0 → rtw88,
  0x8852 → rtw89). Rejects unknown signatures + short blobs.
  `kernel/drivers/net/rtl88xx_fw.cpp` delegates.
- `/kernel/drivers/net/bcm43xx_fw_rust/` (`duetos_bcm43xx_fw`)
  walks the Broadcom b43 8-byte-big-endian record stream
  (`type / version / reserved / be32 size / payload`). Up to 8
  records per blob (configurable cap); convenience indices for
  the first ucode / pcm / iv record. Truncated-on-overflow
  semantics — earlier-records still report cleanly when a
  later record's declared size overflows the blob. The C++
  wrapper converts the Rust-side indices back to in-place
  convenience pointers in the caller-owned struct.
- `/kernel/drivers/gpu/nvidia_gsp_fw_rust/` (`duetos_nvidia_gsp_fw`)
  parses NVIDIA Turing+ GSP firmware containers
  (`gsp_tu10x.bin` / `ga10x.bin` / `ad10x.bin`). The 24-byte
  outer `nvfw_bin_hdr` + per-arch inner descriptor (76 bytes
  Turing/GA100, 84 bytes GA102+) + ELF64 RISC-V payload are all
  attacker-controllable when the install media is hostile.
  Checked arithmetic on `data_offset + data_size`; rejects bad
  magic, bad version, descriptor-too-small, data-bounds, and
  oversize images. `kernel/drivers/gpu/nvidia_gsp_fw.cpp`
  delegates the byte parse to this crate; the C++ side keeps
  the public NvidiaGspFwParse API + boot self-test.
- `/kernel/drivers/gpu/amd_gfx_fw_rust/` (`duetos_amd_gfx_fw`)
  parses AMD GFX9+ microcode images (`linux-firmware` blobs).
  32-byte `common_firmware_header` + optional 12-byte
  `gfx_firmware_header_v1_0` tail (feature version + jump-table
  offset/size) + ucode payload. Validates header_size_bytes vs
  blob, ucode_array_offset+size bound, ucode multiple-of-4,
  and jump-table fits inside the payload — every check via
  checked arithmetic so a hostile peer can't drive a length
  field into wrap-around. `kernel/drivers/gpu/amd_gfx_fw.cpp`
  delegates to this crate.
- `/kernel/util/vt_parser_rust/` (`duetos_vt`) implements the DEC
  ANSI / xterm escape parser. State machine + UTF-8 decoder + CSI
  parameter accumulator + OSC string buffer over a `&mut
  DuetosVtParser` (the C++ side allocates the struct; Rust
  operates on it). Four callbacks (print/execute/csi/osc) cross
  the FFI wall via repr(C) function pointers; the `extern "C"`
  invocations are otherwise plain Rust calls so the parser core
  stays `unsafe`-free outside the three init/reset/feed entry
  points. Untrusted PTY bytes from user processes feed
  `kernel/util/vt_parser.cpp`, which delegates every operation
  to this crate. The compile-time static_assert on
  `sizeof(Parser) == sizeof(DuetosVtParser)` + `sizeof(Callbacks)
  == sizeof(DuetosVtCallbacks)` pins the binary equivalence so a
  future drift on either side can't silently desync.
- `/kernel/net/tls_rust/` (`duetos_tls`) parses TLS 1.2 record
  + handshake byte streams: the 5-byte record header, the
  4-byte handshake header, the ServerHello body (version +
  random + session-id + cipher + compression + optional
  extensions), the Certificate-message body (3-byte total
  list + per-cert length prefix + leaf DER slice), and the
  zero-byte ServerHelloDone. Remote peer controls every
  length prefix; the Rust core uses checked arithmetic to
  reject `u32` length overflows that would otherwise wrap
  under attacker control. `kernel/net/tls.cpp` delegates the
  five `TlsPeek*` / `TlsParse*` entry points to this crate;
  the C++ side keeps AES-GCM record crypto, RSA pre-master
  encryption, the PRF, the transcript hash, and the
  connection lifecycle.
- `/kernel/arch/x86_64/smbios_rust/` (`duetos_smbios`) decodes
  the 2.x (`_SM_` + `_DMI_`) and 3.x (`_SM3_`) entry-point
  anchors (signature + length + 8-bit checksum), then walks the
  variable-length structure table — each call returns the
  bounded `(formatted_offset, strings_offset, end_offset)`
  triple a C++ caller needs to advance to the next record. The
  trailing-strings walker enforces a 1 KiB per-string cap so a
  firmware that omits a NUL terminator can't make the walker
  run past the structure-table slice. `kernel/arch/x86_64/smbios.cpp`
  keeps the legacy-BIOS scan window (`PhysToVirt(0xF0000)` +
  16-byte stride), single-init guarding, the BIOS / system /
  chassis / processor field extraction, and the boot-log line.
- `/kernel/drivers/pci/caps_rust/` (`duetos_pci_caps`) walks both
  the standard capability list (8-bit "next" pointers, head at
  config-space offset 0x34) and the PCIe extended capability
  list (12-bit "next" pointers, head at ECAM offset 0x100).
  Each chain hop is bounded; self-loops, out-of-range pointers,
  unaligned next-offsets, and the all-zero "no ext caps"
  sentinel are clamped to end-of-list. `kernel/drivers/pci/pci.cpp`
  materialises the device's standard config into a 256-byte
  buffer and routes `PciFindCapability` through the crate. The
  new `PciFindExtCapability` entry point is ready for the
  MMCONFIG-routed read primitive that a future PCIe driver
  needing AER / SR-IOV / ATS will add.
- `/kernel/mm/multiboot2_rust/` (`duetos_multiboot2`) validates
  the Multiboot2 info-structure header and walks the tag list +
  the mmap entry array. The bootloader-controlled `total_size`
  is capped at 64 MiB; each tag's `size` field is validated to
  fit in the remaining slice; mmap-entry base+length overflow
  is rejected. `kernel/mm/frame_allocator.cpp::ForEachMmapEntry`
  delegates every cursor advance to the crate.
- `/cmake/DuetOSRust.cmake` exposes `duetos_add_rust_staticlib(...)`, used by
  `/kernel/rust/CMakeLists.txt` to build the aggregate Rust link unit. Its input
  list is derived from the root workspace by `tools/test/check-rust-ffi.py`; a
  missing aggregate dependency or non-member dependency stops configuration.

## Lint + format policy

The workspace pins one `[workspace.lints]` block in `/Cargo.toml`; every
member crate inherits via `[lints] workspace = true`. The deny-set is
intentionally small (`unsafe_op_in_unsafe_fn`, `unused_must_use`,
`non_ascii_idents`, `clippy::todo`, `clippy::unimplemented`,
`clippy::dbg_macro`); `undocumented_unsafe_blocks` is documented as an
aspirational lint pending a SAFETY-comment backfill on the v0 crates.

Style follows idiomatic Rust (K&R braces, default control flow); the
C++ Allman convention does not bleed in. The pin lives in
`/rustfmt.toml`; the local CI preflight (`tools/dev/check-local.sh`)
runs `cargo fmt --check`, `cargo clippy -- -D warnings`, and a host
unit-test smoke (`tools/dev/cargo-host-test.sh`) against every crate
that ships `#[cfg(test)]` modules.

`python tools/test/check-rust-ffi.py` is the separate build-truth and FFI
boundary audit. It inventories every explicit workspace member and checks four
contracts:

1. The aggregate crate has one local dependency and one `pub use` for every
   other workspace member, with no extras.
2. Rust sources, hand-written headers, manifests, literal data includes,
   the canonical repository-root Cargo config, the lockfile, and the pinned toolchain are all
   visible to the CMake archive dependency graph. Kernel crates use the
   conventional in-member source layout: custom target paths, `build.rs`,
   source `include!`, manifest patch/replace tables, and unlisted local path
   dependencies fail closed. Cargo config is exact-schema validated so `paths`,
   source replacement, compiler/wrapper overrides, and nested configs cannot
   redirect the audited graph. The root toolchain file is likewise validated
   against the exact dated channel, component, target, and profile; no other
   rustup override is permitted in the tree.
3. Every raw-pointer export is an `unsafe extern fn` using the single supported
   `C` ABI; a
   safe export is accepted only by exact name in the checker's scalar-only
   allowlist, and a signature change away from C scalars invalidates that entry. Exported
   function using `C-unwind`, `system`, or any other extern ABI is a hard
   finding (`FFI014`). The canonical parity gate enforces the same C-only rule.
4. Rust exports and each crate's hand-written C declarations agree by symbol,
   calling convention, return type, arity, scalar width, pointer depth, and
   pointee constness. The canonical parity gate is
   `tools/test/check-rust-ffi-signatures.py`; any parser error or mismatch is a
   fail-closed `FFI013` build-truth error. `FFI003` also applies a conservative
   lexical check for direct helper signatures that return an unconstrained
   generic or `'static` borrow from a raw pointer.

The normal audit exits nonzero for either build errors or FFI findings. CMake
uses the path-only emit mode: it fails closed on workspace/build-graph errors
and on canonical signature-parity failures, while other FFI findings remain an
   explicit hardening backlog rather than being silently grandfathered into the
   safe-export allowlist. Inventory is a single streaming traversal per member,
   prunes member-root `.git`, `target`, and `__pycache__` output only (nested
   Rust modules with those identifiers remain audited), rejects symlinks and
name-surrogate reparse boundaries, permits contained nonredirecting OneDrive
cloud-filter tags, and enforces global entry, byte, record, diagnostic, and
emitted-output caps before retaining more data. Emitted paths reject CMake-list
and line-protocol delimiters. Existing inputs and every in-repository Cargo
config/toolchain candidate from `kernel/rust` through the repository root are
   configure dependencies, so content edits and newly introduced overrides rerun
   the audit before Cargo. An always-run build target rechecks the graph before
   every requested Rust/kernel build. CMake consumes the bounded exact input list
   rather than recursively globbing member trees, and Cargo is restricted to
   `--lib`, so a newly compiled module requires a tracked source or manifest
   change. The parity checker itself is returned as a CMake build input.

Cargo/rustup configuration above the repository root is not a trusted project
input. CMake runs Cargo from a controlled OS-temporary working directory outside
the repository, recreates its empty Cargo home, and makes the always-run audit
reject any Cargo config on either effective ancestor search path. It also pins
`RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN` and clears compiler/wrapper/flag override variables. Release
jobs explicitly provision that exact dated toolchain with `rust-src` and the
bare-metal target before building. The source audit guarantees the complete
in-repository portion of the configuration search path even though Cargo
receives the validated target/build-std policy through explicit command flags.

`FFI003` is a bounded source-signature heuristic, not a Rust borrow/lifetime
proof. It deliberately catches the current unconstrained helper pattern and may
need extension for macro-generated or type-aliased signatures; every FFI wall
still requires independent unsafe-code review.

## Host unit tests

Workspace `.cargo/config.toml` forces `target = x86_64-unknown-none` +
`unstable.build-std`, which makes `cargo test` unusable directly (the
test harness needs std). `tools/dev/cargo-host-test.sh` works around
this by calling `rustc --test` directly against each crate's
`src/lib.rs`, building a hosted binary with the system libcore +
libstd. New crates that ship `#[cfg(test)]` modules add themselves to
the `HOST_TEST_CRATES` list at the top of the script.

## Contract for a new crate

1. Add the crate directory to the root `[workspace].members` list.
2. Keep the crate standalone: C++ may call Rust through a narrow C FFI, but do
   not create C++ → Rust → C++ → Rust chains.
3. Expose a hand-written C header in the crate's `include/` directory. Bindgen
   and cbindgen are intentionally not part of the kernel build.
4. Keep `unsafe` at the FFI wall. Convert raw C pointers into Rust references
   or slices once, validate null/empty cases first, then keep the parser core in
   safe Rust. Any internal `unsafe` block needs a one-line comment naming the
   kernel invariant that makes it sound.
5. Add the crate as a dependency of `/kernel/rust/Cargo.toml`. Do **not** link
   subsystem crates as independent staticlibs; multiple `build-std` staticlibs
   duplicate `core` / `alloc` symbols.
6. Add the hand-written header path to `kernel/CMakeLists.txt` if C++ code needs
   to include it directly, then expose C++ wrappers through the owning subsystem
   directory. Do not add a second source/header list to
   `/kernel/rust/CMakeLists.txt`; CMake derives those inputs from the workspace.

## CMake shape

Only `/kernel/rust/CMakeLists.txt` calls `duetos_add_rust_staticlib(...)`. It
builds the aggregate `duetos_kernel_rust` staticlib. Before defining the custom
command, `duetos_collect_rust_workspace_depends(...)` validates the explicit
workspace/aggregate relationship and derives all current member source, header,
manifest, and build inputs. `CONFIGURE_DEPENDS` globs are rooted only at those
derived member directories so adding or removing a matching input regenerates
the dependency list without a hand-maintained crate table. A separate FFI
validation stamp depends on every derived input and runs the normal audit before
Cargo, so editing an existing Rust export, header declaration, or checker cannot
reuse an earlier parity result. `kernel/CMakeLists.txt` links the resulting one
`.a` into both kernel ELF stages and includes each subsystem's hand-written C
header directory for C++ wrappers.

The Cargo custom command owns a completion stamp and declares the archive as a
byproduct. Header- or checker-only edits first refresh the validation stamp;
Cargo may then legitimately reuse an unchanged archive, while touching its own
completion stamp records the successful dependency edge without rewriting the
archive or leaving Ninja permanently dirty.

## Profiles

Profiles live only at the workspace root so every kernel-linked crate has the
same panic, LTO, optimization, and overflow-check behavior. Crate-local profile
sections are ignored by cargo once a workspace root exists, so do not add them
back to member crates. The panic handler lives in `/kernel/rust/src/panic.rs`;
subsystem rlibs must not define their own `#[panic_handler]`.

CMake accepts only `DUETOS_RUST_PROFILE=release` (Cargo output directory
`release`) or `DUETOS_RUST_PROFILE=dev` (Cargo's special output directory
`debug`). Any other cache value fails configuration instead of naming an output
archive Cargo may never create.
