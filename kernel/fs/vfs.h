/*
 * DuetOS VFS — v0.
 *
 * "VFS" is generous: today the only backend is ramfs (kernel/fs/ramfs.h),
 * and this header's only responsibility is path resolution starting
 * from an explicit root. The abstraction is shaped so the day a real
 * disk-backed FS lands, the lookup primitive doesn't change — only
 * the leaf "read the bytes" path opens up.
 *
 * The path-resolution rules are deliberately strict and jail-friendly:
 *
 *   - Every resolution starts from a caller-supplied root. There is
 *     NO ambient "global filesystem root". A process's root is
 *     `Process::root` (which the kernel picks at spawn based on
 *     the process's trust level).
 *
 *   - Absolute paths ("/foo/bar") are resolved from the root.
 *     Relative paths ("foo/bar") are resolved from the root.
 *     There is no concept of a per-process "cwd" yet — every path
 *     is root-relative. That's a feature: a sandboxed process
 *     literally cannot name anything outside its root.
 *
 *   - ".." is REJECTED, not interpreted as "parent directory".
 *     Allowing ".." to climb would break sandbox containment the
 *     moment the sandbox root is embedded inside a richer tree.
 *     v0 stays safe-by-default; a future "canonical resolve" can
 *     add ".." with explicit anchoring at the process root.
 *
 *   - "." is accepted and skipped.
 *
 *   - Trailing slashes are tolerated.
 *
 *   - Empty components (consecutive slashes, "//") are tolerated
 *     and skipped.
 *
 *   - Lookups never follow a symlink — we don't have symlinks. If
 *     we ever do, a symlink that points outside the jail root
 *     must resolve through the caller's root, not the kernel's.
 *
 *   - Lookups that walk through a file-typed node fail (can't
 *     `cd` into a regular file).
 *
 * Return value is a const pointer to the resolved node, or nullptr
 * if any component is missing / rejected / malformed. Callers MUST
 * NOT mutate the returned node (everything lives in .rodata today).
 *
 * Context: kernel. Safe at any interrupt level — pure pointer walk
 * over constinit data.

// =====================================================================
// Generic VFS node + cross-mount resolver (Stage 6 second slice).
//
// `VfsLookup` above is ramfs-only by signature: it returns a
// `RamfsNode*` and walks a ramfs tree from a given root. That's
// enough for sandbox enforcement and the constinit trees, but it
// cannot answer "what does `/disk/0/SUB/INNER.TXT` resolve to?"
// because that path crosses a FAT32 mount point — the file lives
// in a different backend.
//
// `VfsResolve` is the cross-mount sibling. It returns a tagged
// `VfsNode` so callers can hold "the resolved thing" without
// caring which backend produced it. Two backends ship today —
// Ramfs (constinit trees + the per-process root) and Fat32
// (registered via `VfsMount` at boot for every probed volume).
// New backends register a `VfsBackendOps` table in `mount.cpp`
// and `VfsResolve` dispatches through `VfsBackendForFsType`.
//
// The `VfsLookup` API is preserved verbatim for ramfs-only
// callers — sandbox enforcement, syscall path resolution against
// `Process::root` — so the two coexist while the fleet of
// callers migrates.
