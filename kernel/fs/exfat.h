/*
 * DuetOS — exFAT driver, v0 probe + root-directory walk.
 *
 * exFAT boot sector (sector 0) signature is "EXFAT   " (EXFAT +
 * 3 spaces) at offset 3. Unlike FAT32 and NTFS, exFAT uses a
 * much simpler boot record layout but still shares the 0x55AA
 * boot signature at offset 510.
 *
 * The root directory is a chain of 32-byte directory entries
 * starting at `first_cluster_of_root`. Each logical "file" is
 * made of a primary entry (type 0x85 File Directory Entry),
 * followed by a stream-extension entry (type 0xC0, carries
 * size + first-cluster + name length), followed by 1..17 file-
 * name entries (type 0xC1, each carries 15 UTF-16 chars). We
 * walk the root cluster only (no recursion) and parse each triad
 * into a `DirEntry` record.
 *
 * Scope:
 *   - Signature probe + boot-sector record.
 *   - Root-directory walk (first cluster only — a multi-cluster
 *     root would need the FAT walk, which is deferred).
 *   - Up to kMaxDirEntries entries captured per volume.
 *   - Root-directory file mutation: write-in-place, append/grow,
 *     create, truncate. Mirrors the proven FAT32 write path
 *     (kernel/fs/fat32_write.cpp + fat32_create.cpp): allocate
 *     free clusters, chain them through the FAT (4-byte LE
 *     entries, EOC == 0xFFFFFFFF), flip the allocation-bitmap
 *     bits, then plant / patch the File (0x85) + Stream-Extension
 *     (0xC0) + FileName (0xC1) dirent set with a correct
 *     SetChecksum and NameHash.
 *   - Offset-aware root-directory file read (ExfatReadAt), mirroring
 *     fat32::Fat32ReadAt. This is the read-dispatch entry point the
 *     VFS mount tier (VfsBackend::Exfat, fs/vfs.h) drives; a volume
 *     only reaches that tier if it passed the ownership gate below.
 *
 * Not in scope (precise GAPs annotated at the call sites):
 *   - Subdirectory targets — create/append/truncate operate on
 *     the ROOT directory's first cluster only.
 *   - Up-case-table-aware name hashing — v0 up-cases ASCII
 *     a-z → A-Z only; the on-disk Up-case Table dirent is not
 *     parsed, so names with non-ASCII letters hash with their raw
 *     code units (still self-consistent on our own volumes).
 *   - Defragmentation / contiguous (NoFatChain) allocation — every
 *     file we create is FAT-chained.
 *   - TexFAT (the transactional safe-FAT second FAT) — volumes
 *     with NumberOfFats == 2 get only FAT #1 maintained.
 *
 * Context: kernel, polling synchronous.
