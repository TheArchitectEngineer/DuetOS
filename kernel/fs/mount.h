/*
 * DuetOS — VFS mount registry, v0 (Stage 6 first slice).
 *
 * A "mount" pairs a backing block device + filesystem type with a
 * mount point in the kernel's path namespace. v0 is BOOKKEEPING
 * ONLY — VfsMount records the binding so the shell (and later
 * VfsLookup) can enumerate active mounts, but lookups themselves
 * still go through the constinit ramfs trees. Teaching VfsLookup
 * to switch backends at a mount point is the Stage 6 second
 * slice; the registry has to land first because a mount point is
 * a prerequisite for the routing slice.
 *
 * The first real consumer is the kernel shell: `mount` lists
 * active mounts; `mount /dev/sda1 /mnt/disk` registers a binding.
 *
 * Context: kernel. Init runs at boot before the first VfsLookup
 * call. The table is a fixed-size flat array — kMaxMounts
 * entries — with linear-scan add / lookup. No locking yet
 * because the only mutator paths are boot init + the kernel
 * shell, both single-threaded today; SMP / multi-process mount
 * will need a spinlock around the table.
