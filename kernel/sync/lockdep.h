/*
 * DuetOS — lockdep-lite, v0 (plan D1 infra).
 *
 * WHAT
 *   A locking-order validator. Maintains a directed graph
 *   `(class A) -> (class B)` recording every "lock A was held when
 *   lock B was acquired" pairing observed at runtime. If both
 *   `A -> B` and `B -> A` ever appear, the order is inverted —
 *   under SMP this is a latent deadlock waiting to happen.
 *
 * WHY THIS, NOT FULL LOCKDEP
 *   Linux's lockdep is a beast: per-class state, recursion, RCU
 *   tracking, irqs-enabled context flags. v0 captures the 90%
 *   case (cycle detection between primary classes) at <300 lines.
 *   Class identification is by u16 ID assigned at the call site;
 *   per-instance disambiguation lands when there's a workload
 *   that needs it.
 *
 * SCOPE
 *   - Graph storage + edge recording + cycle detection.
 *   - Per-CPU held-class stack (`acpi::kMaxCpus` slots, indexed
 *     by `cpu::CurrentCpuIdOrBsp()` inside `Cli`) for spinlock
 *     classes; per-task held-class stack threaded through
 *     `Task` + the context-switch boundary for sleeping mutex
 *     classes (so a mutex held across a yield-and-resume on a
 *     different CPU stays attributed to the holding task).
 *   - Self-test that synthesises `A then B` followed by `B then A`
 *     and asserts an inversion is reported.
 *
 *   NOT IN SCOPE (tracked as D1 follow-ups in the plan):
 *   - Hooking every SpinLock / Mutex / RwLock instance — class
 *     IDs are wired at the primary acquire/release sites; per-
 *     instance disambiguation arrives when a workload needs it.
 *   - Promoting warnings to panics after a stabilisation window.
 *
 * USAGE PATTERN (once primitives are hooked up)
 *
 *     // In some early init code, after the lockdep module is up:
 *     LockdepRegisterClass(kLockClassFrameAllocator, "frame_allocator");
 *     LockdepRegisterClass(kLockClassKHeap,           "kheap");
 *     LockdepRegisterClass(kLockClassSched,           "sched");
 *
 *     // In SpinLockAcquire (future):
 *     LockdepBeforeAcquire(lock.class_id);
 *     /// hardware acquire here ///
 *     LockdepAfterAcquire(lock.class_id);
 *
 *     // In SpinLockRelease (future):
 *     LockdepBeforeRelease(lock.class_id);
 *     /// hardware release here ///
 *
 * THREADING
 *   The graph is mutated under a single SpinLock (in lockdep.cpp).
 *   Lockdep itself uses raw `arch::Cli/Sti` for its critical
 *   section to avoid recursion through SpinLockAcquire when the
 *   primitives are eventually instrumented.

/// WITNESS-style lock-kind taxonomy. A class registration tags each
/// lock with the execution context it lives in so the cross-kind

/// be unsafe to do while holding what you already hold."
///
/// The RULE (enforced in `LockdepBeforeAcquire`):
///
///   While holding a Spin lock, acquiring a Sleep lock is a BUG
///   — the Sleep acquire may yield, but the CPU has interrupts
///   off and another task cannot run on it, so the yield path
///   is unsafe / will deadlock.
///
///   While holding a Sleep lock, acquiring a Spin lock is FINE
///   — a spin acquire never yields, so a Sleep-then-Spin nesting
///   is legal.
///
///   An Irq-kind class is the strictest: held only inside an
///   IRQs-off section. Holding an Irq lock and acquiring a Sleep
///   lock has the same problem as holding a Spin lock and
///   acquiring a Sleep lock, AND the IRQs-off invariant means
///   acquiring another Spin lock under it is fine only if that
///   Spin lock is similarly IRQs-off-safe.
///
/// Concretely, the violation `LockdepBeforeAcquire` reports is:
///
///   - new kind = Sleep AND any held class is Spin or Irq, OR
///   - new kind = Sleep AND held context implies we cannot yield.
///
/// All other combinations are legal. The violation is non-fatal in
/// v0 (just like the existing inversion detector) — bumps the
/// `g_kind_violations` saturating counter and emits one WARN line
/// per occurrence. Non-fatal because the cross-kind discipline is
/// new and the steady-state code may surface latent violations we
